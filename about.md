<p>Hi! I'm Dan Duran. Currently studying computer science full time, but sometimes I like to make some cool and interesting projects. Also Fascinated with outer space and robotics.</p>

<p>I'm strongest in Java and Python, and currently bringing my C and C++ skills up to the same level at <a href="https://www.watonomous.ca/">Watonomous</a> and in school courses.</p>

<p>On the side, I do long distance running. I typically like to do at least one major race per year (i.e half or full marathon) and have been running on/off for the past three years. I've recently picked up photography and plan on posting more of those photos soon. </p>
