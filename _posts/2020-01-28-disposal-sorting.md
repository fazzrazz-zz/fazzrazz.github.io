<h2> Using Tensorflow To Sort Garbage </h2>

This was our main project at Masseyhacks. We used a python program alongside Tensorflow to process images into various waste categories.  

The program takes an image and compares it to thousands of other predefined images in Google's database in an attempt to recognize the object. The program then categorizes the object into either recycling, green bin/compost, or e-waste.
