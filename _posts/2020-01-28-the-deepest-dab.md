Using an xbox kinect to track body movements and achieve the deepest dab possible. By having the kinect sdk from Microsoft do a bit of math, the angles at the joints can be calculated. This was then compared angles from a viral video claiming to be the deepest dab ever. 

Unfortunately, the code was deleted after a hard drive failure. I may potentially look into reviving this at some point.
