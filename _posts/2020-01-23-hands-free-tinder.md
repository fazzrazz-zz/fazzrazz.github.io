<h2> <u>Creative Boredom </u></h2>


<p>So I was at masseyhacks, and had some time to kill. We were currently running our AI through training so we were just waiting around.  </p>
<p> I learned that due to the hackathon being sponsered by MLH, there was hardware that the participents could rent out to tinker with. I found these neat gadgets called the Myo Armband that could track your hand movements and their positionng with several sensors.</p>

<p> After installing the hardware and tinkering around for a bit, I found I could bind the "swipe left" hand gesture to the key on the app to swipe left, and the "swipe right" with the same thing.  So you could literally swipe left and right in the air, away from your phone/computer. Thus, a joke project submission was born </p>
