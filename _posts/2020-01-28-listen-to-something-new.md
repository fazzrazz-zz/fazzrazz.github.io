<h2>Spotify Discover Bi-Weekly</h2>

This was a little project I made when I realized I burned through my spotify discover weekly playlist too quickly. 

It's a reddit bot that scrapes r/listentothis to create a unique youtube playlist every Thursday. It saves me the time of individually clicking links and instead can just run the playlist in a background tab.

Code can be found on github.
